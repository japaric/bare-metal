/// Trait for static (singleton) resources with managed ownership.

/// This trait allows application code and libraries to take ownership of resources that exist once
/// on every core, or once on the entire system.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// In order to safely implement this trait, the implementor must ensure that:
/// - A call to `take()` or `steal()` atomically ensures that no further call to `take()` will
///   succeed. This is commonly accomplished by using a static `AtomicBool` variable and a
///   compare-and-swap operation or a critical section.
/// - It is impossible to link multiple crates containing the synchronization state together. This
///   is usually accomplished by defining a well-known [`links = "..."`][links] key in the
///   `Cargo.toml`.
///
/// [links]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#the-links-manifest-key

    /// Obtains ownership of this resource singleton and makes it unavailable to future callers of

    /// caller's responsibility to use the returned instance in a safe way that does not conflict
    /// with other instances.
    ///
    /// This function is intended to be used when it is statically known that the resource is still
    /// available (for example, in generated code that runs immediately after reset). It generally
    /// has lower cost than `take().unwrap()`.
